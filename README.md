## Pup Party 

Pup Party is a pandemic-era web application designed to connect Chicago-area dog owners for fun, socially-distant dog parties at various parks throughout the city. The app was built on a Rails backend with SQLite db, and utilizes the Material CSS Framework for front-end design. The app allows users to 

- Create a User Account, securely persisted in the database
- Add Dogs to their profile
- View and 'favorite' different Dog Parks throughout the Chicagoland area
- Create a Party with a set date, time, and park location
- View + Join other Parties created by other Users
- Review their Dogs, Favorites, and Parties from their User Page 
- Securely Logout from the site
